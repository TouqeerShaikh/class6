    <p><b>Dear Peter</b></p>
    <p><b>Re: Sales Assistant Vacancy (vacancy number 40568)</b></p>
    <p><b>
        I am writing to apply for the position of Sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on <br>
        Trade Me on 14 February 2013.
    </b></p>
    <p><b>
        I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the <br>
        position, including:
    </b></p>
    <p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>time management and strong organisational skills</li>
            <li>high-level customer service and friendly relationship management</li>
            <li>cash handling and sales ability</li>
            <li>motivation and dedication</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>
        As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer <br>
        service skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The <br>
        Sales Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail <br>
        career.

        my skills to benefit your organisation at an interview.

        Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
